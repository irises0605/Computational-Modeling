## [Radioactive Decay](https://github.com/irises0605/Computational-Modeling/tree/main/radioactive%20decay)
This project contains a MATLAB script that computes and plots the function for what fraction of an original quantity Q0 of radium-226 remains, as a function of years. We use a finite differential equations approach, where we assume that we’re approximating a solution that couldn’t be found. 

## [Monte Carlo Simulation](https://github.com/irises0605/Computational-Modeling/tree/main/monte%20carlo)
In this project, the value of π is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation techniques, where one-fourth of a unit circle is create and we can estimate the value of π indirectly by estimating the area of the circle. 

## [1D Random Walk](https://github.com/irises0605/Computational-Modeling/tree/main/1d%20random%20walk)
This project contains a MATLAB script that simulates W random walks, each with numSteps steps, and boundary distance B.

## [Runge-Kutta 4 Simulation](https://github.com/irises0605/Computational-Modeling/tree/main/rk4)
This project simulates 2D free fall motions using Euler's simulation RK4 simulation techniques. There are 4 models contained in this project:
1.	Euler’s simulation of a ball being thrown straight up from a bridge
2.	RK4 simulation of a ball being thrown straight up from a bridge
3.	RK4 simulation of a ball being thrown straight up from a bridge with revised acceleration
4.	RK4 simulation of a ball being dropped from 400m

## [Predatory Prey Model with RK4](https://github.com/irises0605/Computational-Modeling/tree/main/predator-prey)
This project simulates 2D free fall motions using RK4 Simulation techniques. There are 2 models contained in this project:
1.	Basic Imlementation of Predator-Prey Model 
2.	Revised Predator-Prey Model with other interactions between species

## [Hodgkin-Huxley Model](https://github.com/irises0605/Computational-Modeling/tree/main/hodgkin-huxley)
This project uses MATLAB to simulate a Hodgkin-Huxley model. There are 5 mdoels contained in this project
1.	Implementation of Hodgkin-Huxley model
2.	Modified HH model with Na-K pump
3.	Modified HH model with concentration-sensitive Na-K pump
4.	HH model simulation with different constants
5.	Modified HH model simulation with voltage-sensitive leakage channel

## [Cellular Automata of SIR Model](https://github.com/irises0605/Computational-Modeling/tree/main/cellular%20automata)
This project is about implementing Cellular Automata simulations, building to a SIR model. The SIR Model considers three major population groups in the presence of a disease: susceptibles (S) that have no immunity from the disease, infecteds (I) that have the disease and can spread it to others, and recovereds (R) that have recovered from the disease and are immune to further infection. There includes a hypothesis testing process in the end for research explorations.
